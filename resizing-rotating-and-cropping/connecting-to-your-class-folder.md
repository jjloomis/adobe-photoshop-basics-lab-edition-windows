# Connecting to your class folder

Before you begin working in Photoshop, you'll need to connect to your class folder. Your project folder (and all audio files related to your project) will live in this location.

1. **Right-click** the **Start** button (bottom left) and select **File Explorer.**
2. In the **File Explorer** window, click **This PC** (on left.)&#x20;
3. Click the **Computer** tab (top of window.) In the drop-down menu, select **Map network drive**.&#x20;
4. Leave the default **Drive** letter selected. In the **Folder** field, copy and paste the following string (be sure to copy the full string): \
   \
   `\\ad.uwm.edu\shares\_U_LS\Courses\JAMS`\

5. Click **Finish**. Your class folder will appear in the **This PC** area as a connected drive.&#x20;
