# Creating a project folder

Before starting a Photoshop project, you'll need to create a project folder. All image files associated with your project will live in this project folder with your Photoshop project file (PSD.)

Never rename, move or delete the media files in your project folder. Your PSD file references these files. If your PSD file can't locate a media file, it will appear offline in your project.

1. On your PC, navigate to your [class folder](connecting-to-your-class-folder.md).
2. Right-click in your class folder. In the fly-out menu, select **New Folder**.
3. Give this folder a new name using [JAMS file and folder naming conventions](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/file-and-folder-naming-conventions.html).
